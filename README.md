# Snack Bar App [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/fabinhojorge/snackbarapp.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/fabinhojorge/snackbarapp)
A simple project with a real business case to practice Django knowledge 


# Introduction
The idea of this project is to study some technologies like:
* Django
* CLI
* Tests
* Django template

# Business
The systemwill allow the user (_Owner_) to register new product and his igredients, in a relation of _NxN_ that a product may have more _0..N_ igredients.
Also, the user (_Client_) can construct his own snack/amburguer, and the system will provide the price of the product based in some rules (_that we still need to create :)_)


# To Do
[ ] _Still planing :)_
